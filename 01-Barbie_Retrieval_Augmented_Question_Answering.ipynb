It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 26 July 2023\\nAuthor: aherdofbeautifulwildponies\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A Hot Pink Mess\\nReview: Before making Barbie (2023),\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: Revuer223\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.\\nReview: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 31 July 2023\\nAuthor: ramair350\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that\\'s ok.\\nReview: As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 3}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: Natcat87\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too heavy handed\\nReview: As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot.

The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for.

Great cast.\\nReview: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 20}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: finnconnelly-63017\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Ken out of ten\\nReview: Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 21}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 27 December 2023\\nAuthor: Ed-Shullivan\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: I would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute TV sitcom\\nReview: Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 22}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: AngelHonesty\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Not what I Expected\\nReview: I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 28}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: andypaps101\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: \"Barbie\" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism\\nReview: I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go.

However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 36}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: anjamulder\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: not for everyone\\nReview: This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 13 September 2023\\nAuthor: ambusched94\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling's performances bolster a film with messaging that is heavy-handed and bordering on exhaustingly preachy most of the time\\nReview: The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable.

A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 45}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 15 December 2023\\nAuthor: brockfal\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A lot of fun....\\nReview: Firstly, let's just say that I am not in the ideal demographic for 'Barbie', being male, 66 years old, and I don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick. On so many levels this is a clever and tremendously entertaining film and I really loved it - even an old guy like me....\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 46}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: mark-217-307033\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Fun film whose script falls in on itself\\nReview: Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does.

A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting \"grown-ups\", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 54}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: jacobarch\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: Did I watch the same movie as everyone else lol\\nReview: While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast.

And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was.

It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 58}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: dreopdreef\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Not so unique as expected\\nReview: The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 61}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 27 August 2023\\nAuthor: max-850\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Preacher Barbie?\\nReview: I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It\\'s preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging.

Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them.

It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 66}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: spika13\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too overrated\\nReview: Its like watching at \"Truman\\'s show\" but all the set it\\'s pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas.

Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of \"girls can do anything\" and \"find yourself.\" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women\\'s appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it\\'s essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood\\'s consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world\\'s most profit-driven film industry.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 69}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: jp_91\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Barbie existentialism.\\nReview: Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. \"Barbie\" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie\\'s performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig\\'s work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. \"Barbie\" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 70}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 20 August 2023\\nAuthor: Leofwine_draca\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A real mixed bag\\nReview: BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 71}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: MaskedMinty\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Preach Preach Preach\\nReview: Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more.

Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 75}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 5 August 2023\\nAuthor: sjw1029\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: The movie event of 2023 lives up to the hype\\nReview: Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office.

So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end.

For me the highlight of this movie is the opening in the world of \"Barbieland\" which is colorful and visually stunning with some campy humor and a look into the repetitive lives of these living dolls, particularly the stereotypical Barbie, played brilliantly played by Margo Robbie who is pure perfection in the role, and her hunky dimwitted boyfriend Ken, terrifically played by Ryan Gosling who earned an Oscar nomination for his scene-stealing turn, but once Barbie and Ken leave Barbieland and enter the real world the entire lighthearted tone of the film ends, it becomes a negative and turns into a weird war between men and women, I found this part of the film very boring and did not find it funny or entertaining, it turns preachy and dialogue-heavy. Gerwig\\'s direction is solid, but the most impressive thing about this film is its sensational production design which is amazing, some cute musical numbers with Barbie and Ken, and the superb cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. The supporting performances are all good, but why America Ferrera got an Oscar nomination for her okay performance is beyond me, however special kudos must go to Rhea Perlman who delivers an wonderfully endearing performance in an extended cameo. The film is a disappointment to me that could of been way better, no masterpiece here just a good film.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 89}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 29 July 2023\\nAuthor: connor707\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Not made for me but loved nonetheless\\nReview: As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film.

She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it.

The second hour of the movie is a stark contrast to the first hour. There were funny moments mixed with thoughtful gender roles, views on our patriarchal society, self-worth, etc. That took a complicated subject and made it interesting in the first half. The problem is, the movie then begins to take itself too seriously and the second half loses the clever comedy and pushes stereotypes of male and female gender roles in our society to become a rushed mess of a story that becomes preachy. There are a lot of issues in today's society with regards to gender roles, feminism, our patriarchal society, etc. The problem is the movie seems to take on some of these issues with comedy, then takes a more serious tone, and rushes through the second half so that characters brought forward in the first half have no real resolution. Sure Barbie finds her purpose at the movie's end, but it becomes a mess to get there. The rich comedy common in the first half turns to slapstick and serious drama. Are there two more opposites than slapstick and drama? The first half had me rethinking my views on how women are treated with it's lighthearted comedy, while the second half had me bothered by pushing male stereotypes into a slapstick war and a rush to finish while also being preached to about male and female gender roles. The movie seems to lose it's purpose and then rushes for a resolution. The mom and daughter story would have been better explored with a light hearted comedy that touches on gender roles and a woman's self-worth, and making it for the whole family but especially focused on an audience of young girls and women who are trying to figure out who they are. It really should have explored the mother and daughter characters and how they each struggle with being a woman in society and used Barbie as a tool of them helping to better understand each other. The movie glosses over this and despite their differences their complicated relationship is easily fixed as the focus turns back to Barbie and the focus on her. The movie brings up good ideas and a good story to once again have Hollywood ruin it. It loses focus as too many ideas, issues, characters, and plots, are brought up, to have it rushed to a finish with only some resolved. All a common problem with too many Hollywood movies these days. What is the purpose of your story? Who is it written for? Why are you writing it? Focus on that, and don't let others over complicate it. It's sad that a movie that brings up important issues especially with women's self-worth with both older and younger women is ruined by too much of everything else this movie takes on.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 91}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: shadowtramp\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: More of a marketing flick\\nReview: The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 95}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 15 August 2023\\nAuthor: EUyeshima\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos\\nReview: There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 96}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 10 September 2023\\nAuthor: Lincsobserver\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Colourful, but confusing\\nReview: Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 97}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 16 August 2023\\nAuthor: bhernandez2216\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: A beautiful Barbie movie in 2023!!!\\nReview: Wow!!!

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 101}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 19 September 2023\\nAuthor: BA_Harrison\\nRating: 1\\nReview_Title: Not for me.\\nReview: Barbie (Margot Robbie) travels from Barbieland to the real world where she learns to her surprise that men are in control...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 102}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 31 July 2023\\nAuthor: christinawilliams-64144\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Barbie Fantastic!\\nReview: The acting was amazing.

She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch. I forsee the movie getting nominated for best actress ( Margot Robbie ) and for production design, costume design , make up and cinematography.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 107}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: 🏩 Possibly a Masterpiece? 💒\\nReview: I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 109}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: tforbes-2\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Mind blowing\\nReview: Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way!

By the time I was able to view the film I had high expectations. There were certainly extremely funny moments, but for me few and far between. Gosling was singled out by many as the best in the film and I agreed there were enough outlandish moments with his character that earned him that. But, I thought that Michael Cera's character Allan was far funnier, even though his role was more of an extended cameo. I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support). It may have been the build up prior to seeing the movie that actually resulted in it not reaching my expectations.

The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there\\'s a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It\\'s not; it\\'s just more entertaining. The only \"weak\" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives.

The first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. We see Barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. When she decides to go to the \"real world,\" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn\\'t much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 122}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: kimberlyely-27550\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Everyone watch this\\nReview: Barbie\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 123}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 15 October 2023\\nAuthor: vithiet\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: I didn\\'t think they would, but they managed to make it fun!\\nReview: Context: I\\'m a single, straight, childless, 40+ yo dude who rides motorcycles, does kickboxing, and drinks my whisky neat.

I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie\\'s original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren\\'t the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 126}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 16 August 2023\\nAuthor: southdavid\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Kenchanting Kentertainment\\nReview: Based purely on having come out of one film and planning to see whatever fit in next, I went to see \"Barbie\" this weekend.

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 130}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: jboothmillard\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Barbie\\nReview: The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn\\'t ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. \"Stereotypical\" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha\\'s comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha\\'s mother Gloria (Ugly Betty\\'s America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society\\'s conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie\\'s self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken\\'s friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland\\'s previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls \"wanted to be\"; she named \"Barbie\" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie\\'s story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi\\'s Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education\\'s Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls\\' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable \"stereotypical\" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (\"Pink\" by Lizzo, \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa) (the original \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 131}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: gianthaole\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Way too preachy\\nReview: My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer.

This is a totally meta movie, so self-conscious. It knows what it stands for, what it wants to say and what it represents. It\\'s a work done by a woman, it\\'s obvious in every dialogue and every frame. Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it\\'s actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. \"Barbie\" is all about self-identity and discovery and it\\'s a journey to accepting once self and loving it. \"Barbie\" is the Barbie doll we know and still this movie showcases the effect of her on our lives now. It examines all the good and the bad \"Barbie\" has given to the world. It\\'s a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it\\'s made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. \"Barbie\" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. \"Barbie\" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is \"Barbie\", you simply believe it. She\\'s given us her absolute best and it shows in every frame. Ryan Gosling must have had an absolute blast with Ken. He simply got the assignment. Their dynamic is a way to examine the gender dynamics of our world.

The film has some fun moments (especially in the first third) and fabulous imagery but the social-messaging was a bit heavy-handed and I quickly lost interest in the story, especially during the interminable and unmemorable song-and dance numbers. Anyone interested in a parody of 'Mattel's Barbie' would be better served watching 'Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy' (Simpsons s.5, ep.14), which is much more clever, funnier, and a lot shorter.

The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for.

I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying \"Stereotypical\" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn\\'t always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing.

Instead the opening Barbie World sequence goes way too long, and then the 'real' world she goes to isn't just short, it's more plastic and silly than Barbie World. When she returned to Barbie World, I couldn't take anymore and switched off. My advice? If you're not hooked by the first 15 minutes, do the same.

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 149}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 28 July 2023\\nAuthor: klastaitas\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: We're All Dolls\\nReview: Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 150}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 7 January 2024\\nAuthor: atleverton\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Not a film that will hold up (and not because of its politics)\\nReview: This movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. There are good and funny moments of the film, but I don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. It claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. The dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. The Kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. The rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. And the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. Stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. The dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. So if there is sort of a matriarchal Utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. So the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the Barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the Kens are learning about the real me. But they're not real. They're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. That's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the Barbie holds hands with Barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. But in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. So this Barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. She hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? I don't mind films having ideologies, but I think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which I can follow. Apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. And I think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in Hollywood blockbusters. But the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 151}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: levybob\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Why Didn't I Love This Movie?\\nReview: Why didn't I love 'Barbie'?

It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 153}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 26 July 2023\\nAuthor: nysmbs\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third\\nReview: Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 154}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: elihebdon\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: This film isn\\'t saying what it thinks it is\\nReview: Margot does the best with what she\\'s given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, l\\'m in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 155}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 27 July 2023\\nAuthor: tylertubisjr\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Barbie with a life lesson\\nReview: I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great.

From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous.

The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound.

There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that. I guess it would just be too traditional if that was the conclusion in this movie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 178}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 13 August 2023\\nAuthor: dililith\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Laughed and cried so much\\nReview: It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 179}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 27 July 2023\\nAuthor: grinningelvis\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie\\nReview: The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly.

This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 181}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: msbecca00\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Not as clever as it thinks it is\\nReview: I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that.

What do you get when you\\'re part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren\\'t exactly human (they don\\'t even have genitals); they\\'re embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the \"real world.\" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it\\'s a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 183}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: bankofmarquis\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: More Than Meets The Eye\\nReview: The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film.

That says more about their own sense of masculinity than about the quality of the movie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 190}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 15 August 2023\\nAuthor: adsmradford\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Billion Dollar Barbie.\\nReview: I doubt this film will be remembered in 80 years.

Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song \"You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,\" but at some point I realize it\\'s way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it\\'s so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it\\'s so beautiful. Yet, it\\'s such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It\\'s a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard.

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 195}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 5 December 2023\\nAuthor: comedyfan71\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Overrated, could have been much better\\nReview: Barbie is really not a good film.

It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal.

But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it\\'s left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn\\'t like Ken, it\\'s wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it\\'s iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn\\'t really like that.

It made huge amounts of money and had an incredible start at the box office. I wanted to see it, but the stars didn't align. Since I had read no reviews and had not talked to anyone who had seen it, I went in quite objectively. Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third. I started looking at the clock which is not a good sign. The cast is good, although Ryan Gosling isn't dull enough to be Ken. He is never boring, even at the beginning. I'm glad I saw this because it is a cultural phenomenon (even though it doesn't deserve it). The message is a good one and spot on. It's just delivered in a less than stellar way.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 205}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 9 September 2023\\nAuthor: jtkwtc\\nRating: 2\\nReview_Title: Started out well but puttered out\\nReview: I was excited by the hype from this movie.

I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me. I've never understood his appeal.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 208}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 5 August 2023\\nAuthor: jaysnewish\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Kentastic!\\nReview: I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I\\'d go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the \"I\\'m just Ken\" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I\\'m glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn\\'t just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if \"I\\'m just Ken\" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can\\'t find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him.

Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film.

I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, \"Why can\\'t Barbie just sing a song?!\" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis.

The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the \"greatest movie of all time\" and \"Oscar-worthy\" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn\\'t give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don\\'t have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 229}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: a-hilton\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Had me smiling all the way through\\nReview: Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos.

Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 232}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: ilikelickingeyeballs\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Good but not that good.\\nReview: The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 233}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 10 February 2024\\nAuthor: catkins777\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: I wanted love with this movie...\\nReview: But I didn't.

It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 241}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 8 January 2024\\nAuthor: ben-snooks\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: I didn't laugh once\\nReview: I had trouble following this story. I got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. In a nutshell the story is as follows. Barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves Barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. Meanwhile Ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in Barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other Ken dolls to take power by force. Meanwhile the Barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take Barbieland back. Somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. The end. I didn't laugh once so I'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. I was also disappointed when Ken and Barbie broke out into song in the final act. It seems that whenever Hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. This film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. The characters were so boring. Nothing much happens and then I was just left waiting for the film to finish. I don't expect this film to win many awards. It was more of an idea than a film with substance. I suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with American consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's American ideals of beach culture and beauty. The film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, Alf and fruity loops cereal. However, Barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. Some things should be left to age gracefully into history. Especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 242}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: westy-47313\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Yes\\nReview: Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors.

The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well.

The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 260}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: pete-murphy97\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Not Kenough\\nReview: Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic \"bimbo\".

Thats all that was good.\\nReview: I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of \"manly\". Overall it was just super weird and not that funny.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 266}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: UniqueParticle\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Spectacular!\\nReview: Family/adult film mashed in really well!

We need more movies like this one!\\nReview: Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 272}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 15 December 2023\\nAuthor: Drawmort\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Relevant and forgettable at the same time\\nReview: Yes, we have a socially relevant film, perhaps with topics already touched on in other works, but we must recognize that it was necessary to do it from the perspective, the seal and the criticism of and towards the figure of Barbie.

Highly imaginative, (it\\'s got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it\\'s got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called \"Barbie\" that we\\'re watching), it\\'s as a tract that it\\'s in danger of sinking.

It was on my list of most-anticipated movies and I had heard so many good things about it. But Barbie let me down. I wish that the filmmakers had put as much effort into the screenplay as they did the sets, costumes, and Barbie references. Barbie has a really fun look, but the plot seems like it was cobbled together by seven-year-olds and then coated with a layer of cynicism. Barbie also isn't as humorous as I expected it to be. I think I only laughed out loud once. And most of the jokes feel like lectures.

A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 287}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: Pairic\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A Great Comedy & Satire\\nReview: Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 288}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: lee_eisenberg\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: If you want it, here it is.

All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie.

The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending. The heart would be pink, the tears would be pink, hereby you'll love pink.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 301}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: paulhopfish\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Must admit I struggled!\\nReview: I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded.

With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 304}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: Imaculata\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Funny and entertaining but kind of a mess\\nReview: The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 305}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 12 August 2023\\nAuthor: hollieking81\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Thought it would be cheesy\\nReview: But was pleasantly surprised. I found it very emotional. Fabulous casting, dancing and soundtrack. My daughters 6 and 8 also loved it. My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between. I am so glad I could see a movie like this with my daughters.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 306}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 20 September 2023\\nAuthor: Gelaos\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: A mix of somewhat funny summer-movie and social commentary.

The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing \"lego movie\" and \"barbie goes to the real world\" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera\\'s character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn\\'t come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 308}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: colbiroy\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: In Awe\\nReview: I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this.

The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 311}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 11 August 2023\\nAuthor: maritsmits\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Laughed tears and that's Kenough\\nReview: I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch.

However, I won\\'t lie to you and say that it\\'s really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn\\'t a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a \"good movie\" with. Now I can\\'t say that I wasn\\'t entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women\\'s issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an \"everyone movie\", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don\\'t get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of \"Barbieland\". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they\\'re toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn\\'t want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to \"do anything to see it in theaters again\", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 316}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 5 August 2023\\nAuthor: MovieFanatic1995\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: One of the Best Comedies of the Year\\nReview: I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 317}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 26 February 2024\\nAuthor: view_and_review\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Shattered Utopia\\nReview: Barbie was another movie that fell victim to its own hype.

It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious.

We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman.

Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone.

A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 45}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 15 December 2023\\nAuthor: brockfal\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A lot of fun....', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 46}), Document(page_content=\"Author: brockfal\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A lot of fun....\\nReview: Firstly, let's just say that I am not in the ideal demographic for 'Barbie', being male, 66 years old, and I don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick.

A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting \"grown-ups\", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 54}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: jacobarch\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: Did I watch the same movie as everyone else lol\\nReview: While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast.

And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came.

On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others.

It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game.

Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 97}), Document(page_content='Review_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 97}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 16 August 2023\\nAuthor: bhernandez2216\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: A beautiful Barbie movie in 2023!!!\\nReview: Wow!!!

So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself.

This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 153}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 26 July 2023\\nAuthor: nysmbs\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third\\nReview: Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece.

The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit.

Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though!

However, i was not disappointed in the film, and especially by the performance of Margot Robbie, who had already made a big splash with her quirky and entertaining Suicide Squad role. Ryan Gosling is fine as Ken, but I thought that another actor might have been a more appropriate choice, as Gosling is a fine dramatic actor, but is not really noted for satire or comedy.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 321}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 2 October 2023\\nAuthor: uebermut-1\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: Dawn, that flic was hollow\\nReview: I was very surprise as the film turned out to be a very hollow matter. Why did they stretch the \"Hello Barbie\"-\"Hello Barbie\" joke all over the movie. Running gag? This film was so boring, the jokes so unadventurous, the characters so flat. The film was the look and feel of a 20 minute-TV-show stretched to infinity. Ryan Gosling was cool, but in the wrong movie. Margot Robbie is beautiful. That\\'s it. She squeezed exactly one characteristic out of the puppet. After watching the film a would have assumed it would make 20 bio at the box office. What was I wrong.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 322}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 6 August 2023\\nAuthor: madisonsolomon\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Beautiful\\nReview: This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 323})]\n"

It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\n",

Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 230}),\n",

He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 128}),\n",

The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9243378/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 111}),\n",

It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world.
